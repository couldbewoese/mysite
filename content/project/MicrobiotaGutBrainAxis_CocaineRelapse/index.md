There is a growing body of research relating gut dysbiosis and pathogenesis of diseases and disorders (obesity, autism, and mood-anxiety disorders). However, despite the high rates of comorbidity between mood-anxiety and substance use disorders in humans, little work has explored the connection between gut microbiota alterations and the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Based on my belief that eukaryotes (especially humans) have evolved to be highly connected to and dependent on microbial residents for physiological health, I see potential to build on the current work in two fields with space for much progress: 1) the microbiota-gut-brain axis and 2) stimulant addiction/relapse prevention. Therefore, for my final project in my [Systtems Neuroscience](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2122F/NEUR/NEUR-245-2122F) course at Amherst I created a research proposal that explores the potential role of gut microbiota metabolites on cocaine relapse susceptibility.
