In the Segre Lab at the NHGRI, I worked with *Candida auris* nanopore and RNA sequences from a US hospital outbreak to develop an in-house annotation pipeline for the fungus's genome that utilizes [Funannotate](https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate). Annotation of the genome is a critical step in finding pathogenic features and differences between clades. I tested several training parameters and compared the outputs of my annotations to those made by NISC (NIH Intramural Sequencing Center) and available in NCBI's GenBank.

I presented my findings to the Transnational and Functional Genomics Branch of the NHGRI and at the NIH summer poster session.
